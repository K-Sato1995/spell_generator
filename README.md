# SpellGenerator

It generates a random spell.

## Why I created this project

Welcome!! I created this project specifically for helping people take the first step of their OSS journeys‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

Contributing to an OSS project can be intimidating if you don't know how to do to it or have never experienced it. But if you know the process of making a PR and have already done it before, it can be very simple and fun.  
That's why I want you to contribute to this project by opening an issue or making a PR to practice/start contributing to other OSS projects‚ú®‚ú®!!

Originally I started this project with [this post](https://dev.to/ksato1995/anybody-who-wants-to-start-practice-contributing-to-oss-projects-59np) on [dev.to](https://dev.to/).

## If you are not a begginer

You can contribute to the project and the whole dev community by opening an issue here or helping new devs to complete their PRsüòä.  
Some wonderful people have already opened some issues and also created PRs.
I wholeheartedly appreciate themüôèüôè.

Or you are always very welcome to tackle any issue, even if you are not a begginer,
